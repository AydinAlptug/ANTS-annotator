# DatasetQualityAnalysis

We provide 3 scripts to analyze the quality of data markers.

## Motion Trajectory Visualization

Run the `generate_videos.py` script to display the annotated motion trajectories on each image sequence, and you will get videos in `.mp4` format.

## Motion speed visualization and analysis

Run the `visualize_speed.py` script to get the heat map and frequency histogram of the motion velocity distribution of ants in each image sequence.

## Motion speed calculation

Run the `calculate_speedfeature.py` script to get the overall statistics of the motion speed of ants in each image sequence.
